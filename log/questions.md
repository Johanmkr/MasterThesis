# Questions/discussion points to adress supervisors

## To David:

## To Paco
* ML
    * Skeleton pipeline of CNN (architecture) for the snapshots
    * Other ML techniques for power spectra and light cones - SVM, XGB, RF etc.
    * Different network for the different snapshot types (scalar, vector tensor) due to dimensionality?
* Data
    * Augmentation and recycling
    * Create PyTorch dataset and dataloader objects

    


## To Julian
* Detecting relativistic effects:
    * Which output type should be best suited?
    * Which quantities (tensor perturbations?), and their strength
    * Spatial and temporal scales (close to horizon scales)

## To Farbod
