# Things to do

## Project in general
* [  ] 

## Data preperation
* [  ]  
* [  ] How would relativistic effects be manifest?
* [  ] Write function to convert from .h5 $\to$ PyTorch Dataset object, and concatenate files into an iterable Dataloader object. 

## ML pipeline
* [  ] Skeleton code of some network model in order to start testing. 
    * Normalise data, feed through skeleton pipeline. 

## Misc
* [  ] Write script to find all ###TODS in python scripts and list them
* [  ] Write parser to initialise pytorch network and model object from .ini file.
