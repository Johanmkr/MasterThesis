# Things to do

## Project in general
* [] 

## Simulations
All of the below have box size 5210 Mpc
* [] Run and time simulation with resolution: 128
* [] Run and time simulation with resolution: 256
* [] Run and time simulation with resolution: 512

## Summary statistics
* [] Calculate bi-spectrum from one  of the simulations using Pylians. Information in documentation. What is the duration of sampling here. 

## Data preperation
* [] Fix normalisation. 

## ML pipeline
* [x] Skeleton code of some network model in order to start testing. 
 

## Misc
* [] Write script to find all ###TODS in python scripts and list them
* [] Write parser to initialise pytorch network and model object from .ini file.
