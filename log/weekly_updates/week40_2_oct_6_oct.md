# Week 40, 2. october - 6. october

_Long time since the last weekly update, but been doing mainly cube analysis and verification, which I find quite hard. At the same time been reading some theory and started writing the thesis text (barely)_

On the different verification:

## Power spectra

Have both the output from _gevolution_ directly and the power spectra calculated with Pylians. Some gauge difficulties:

    Q: How to plot both power spectra from gevolution in the same gauge (they are now in synchronous gauge (GR) and newtonian gauge), but the power spectra of the two should be indistinguishable. 

Plan is to compare CLASS and CAMB matter power spectra with the output of gevolution and then to compare the output of gevolution (potential) with the power spectrum found from the cube itself, which will be the potential power spectrum, which is gauge-invariant. 

## Bispectra

Need to use these to showcase the difference between Newtonian and relativistic N-body cubes.  

### Trusting the bispectra:
* Compare with analytical approximation: $F_2$ kernel amongst other things. 
* With variance for different limits: squeezed and equilateral

### Alternative
* Modal bispectra (article from Frode)
* Relativistic effects on smaller scales (article from David)

Verification:

    Q: When are the cubes 'verified'?
