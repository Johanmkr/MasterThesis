	abstract = {We present a new N-body code, gevolution, for the evolution of large scale structure in the Universe. Our code is based on a weak ﬁeld expansion of General Relativity and calculates all six metric degrees of freedom in Poisson gauge. N-body particles are evolved by solving the geodesic equation which we write in terms of a canonical momentum such that it remains valid also for relativistic particles. We validate the code by considering the Schwarzschild solution and, in the Newtonian limit, by comparing with the Newtonian N-body codes Gadget-2 and {RAMSES}. We then proceed with a simulation of large scale structure in a Universe with massive neutrinos where we study the gravitational slip induced by the neutrino shear stress. The code can be extended to include diﬀerent kinds of dark energy or modiﬁed gravity models and going beyond the usually adopted quasi-static approximation. Our code is publicly available.},

	abstract = {Several recent studies have shown how to properly calculate the observed clustering of galaxies in a relativistic context, and uncovered corrections to the Newtonian calculation that become significant on scales near the horizon. Here, we retrace these calculations and show that, on scales approaching the horizon, the observed galaxy power spectrum depends strongly on which gauge is assumed to relate the intrinsic fluctuations in galaxy density to matter perturbations through a linear bias relation. Starting from simple physical assumptions, we derive a gauge-invariant expression relating galaxy density perturbations to matter density perturbations on large scales, and show that it reduces to a linear bias relation in synchronous-comoving gauge, corroborating an assumption made in several recent papers. We evaluate the resulting observed galaxy power spectrum, and show that it leads to corrections similar to an effective non-Gaussian bias corresponding to a local (effective) {fNL} {\textless} 0.5. This number can serve as a guideline as to which surveys need to take into account relativistic effects. We also discuss the scale-dependent bias induced by primordial non-Gaussianity in the relativistic context, which again is simplest in synchronous-comoving gauge.},

To calculate these effects one needs to consistently solve for the metric, densities and velocities in a specific coordinate system or gauge. The method of choice for simulating large-scale structure is numerical N-body simulations which are performed in the Newtonian limit. Even though one might worry that the use of the Newtonian approximation would make it impossible to use these simulations to compute properties on very large-scales, we show that the simulations are still solving the dynamics correctly even for long modes and we give formulas to obtain the position of particles in the conformal Newtonian gauge given the positions computed in the simulation. We also give formulas to convert from the output coordinates of N-body simulations to the observable coordinates of the particles.},

	abstract = {Cosmological N -body simulations are now being performed using Newtonian gravity on scales larger than the Hubble radius. It is well known that a uniformly expanding, homogeneous ball of dust in Newtonian gravity satisﬁes the same equations as arise in relativistic {FLRW} cosmology, and it also is known that a correspondence between Newtonian and relativistic dust cosmologies continues to hold in linearized perturbation theory in the marginally bound/spatially ﬂat case. Nevertheless, it is far from obvious that Newtonian gravity can provide a good global description of an inhomogeneous cosmology when there is signiﬁcant nonlinear dynamical behavior at small scales. We investigate this issue in the light of a perturbative framework that we have recently developed [1], which allows for such nonlinearity at small scales. We propose a relatively straightforward “dictionary”—which is exact at the linearized level—that maps Newtonian dust cosmologies into general relativistic dust cosmologies, and we use our “ordering scheme” to determine the degree to which the resulting metric and matter distribution solve Einstein’s equation. We ﬁnd that, within our ordering scheme, Einstein’s equation fails to hold at “order 1” at small scales and at “order ǫ” at large scales. We then ﬁnd the additional corrections to the metric and matter distribution needed to satisfy Einstein’s equation to these orders. While these corrections are of some interest in their own right, our main purpose in calculating them is that their smallness should provide a criterion for the validity of the original “dictionary” (as well as simpliﬁed versions of this dictionary). We expect that, in realistic Newtonian cosmologies, these additional corrections will be very small; if so, this should provide strong justiﬁcation for the use of Newtonian simulations to describe relativistic cosmologies, even on scales larger than the Hubble radius.},

In this work we present an attempt to bridge this gap by studying the bispectrum, paying particular attention to a joint analysis with the power spectrum and their combination with {CMB} data. We address the covariance properties of the power spectrum and bispectrum including the effects of beat coupling that lead to interesting cross-correlations, and discuss how baryon acoustic oscillations break degeneracies. We show that the bispectrum has significant information on cosmological parameters well beyond its power in constraining galaxy bias, and when combined with the power spectrum is more complementary than combining power spectra of different samples of galaxies, since non-Gaussianity provides a somewhat different direction in parameter space. In the framework of flat cosmological models we show that most of the improvement of adding bispectrum information corresponds to parameters related to the amplitude and effective spectral index of perturbations, which can be improved by almost a factor of two. Moreover, we demonstrate that the expected statistical uncertainties in sigma8 of a few percent are robust to relaxing the dark energy beyond a cosmological constant.},

	abstract = {Upcoming surveys of cosmic structures will probe scales close to the cosmological horizon, which opens up new opportunities for testing the cosmological concordance model to high accuracy. In particular, constraints on the squeezed bispectrum could rule out the single-field hypothesis during inflation. However, the squeezed bispectrum is also sensitive to dynamical effects of general relativity as well as interactions of matter with residual radiation from the early Universe. In this paper, we present a relativistic simulation pipeline that includes these relativistic effects consistently. We produce light cones and calculate the observed number counts of cold dark matter for five redshift bins between z = 0.55-2.25. We compare the relativistic results against reference Newtonian simulations by means of angular power- and bispectra. We find that the dynamical relativistic effects scale roughly inversely proportional to the multipole in the angular power spectrum, with a maximum amplitude of 10\% for ℓ ≲ 5. By using a smoothing method applied to the binned bispectrum we detect the Newtonian bispectrum with very high significance. The purely relativistic part of the matter bispectrum, obtained by subtracting the Newtonian bispectrum from the relativistic one, is detected with a significance of ∼ 3 σ, mostly limited by cosmic variance. We find that the pure dynamical relativistic effects accounts for up to 3\% and 10\% of the total amplitude, respectively in the squeezed and equilateral limits. Our relativistic pipeline for modelling ultra-large scales yields gauge-independent results as we compute observables consistently on the past light cone, while the Newtonian treatment employs approximations that leave some residual gauge dependence. A gauge-invariant approach is required in order to meet the expected level of precision of forthcoming probes of cosmic structures on ultra-large scales.},

	abstract = {{LCDM} is remarkably successful in predicting the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure, and {LCDM} parameters have been determined with only mild tensions between different types of observations. Hydrodynamical simulations starting from cosmological initial conditions are increasingly able to capture the complex interactions between dark matter and baryonic matter in galaxy formation. Simulations with relatively low resolution now succeed in describing the overall galaxy population. For example, the {EAGLE} simulation in volumes up to 100 cubic Mpc reproduces the observed local galaxy mass function nearly as well as semi-analytic models. It once seemed that galaxies are pretty smooth, that they generally grow in size as they evolve, and that they are a combination of disks and spheroids. But recent {HST} observations combined with high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations are showing that most star-forming galaxies are very clumpy; that galaxies often undergo compaction which reduces their radius and increases their central density; and that most lower-mass star-forming galaxies are not spheroids or disks but are instead elongated when their centers are dominated by dark matter. We also review {LCDM} challenges on smaller scales: cusp-core, "too big to fail," and substructure issues. Although starbursts can rapidly drive gas out of galaxy centers and thereby reduce the dark matter density, it remains to be seen whether this or other baryonic physics can explain the observed rotation curves of the entire population of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies. If not, perhaps more complicated physics such as self-interacting dark matter may be needed. But standard {LCDM} appears to be successful in predicting the dark matter halo substructure that is now observed via gravitational lensing and breaks in cold stellar streams, and any alternative theory must do at least as well.},

First we review in detail practical estimators of statistics in galaxy catalogs and related errors, including traditional approaches and more recent developments.

One such eﬀect involves deciding whether to zero all modes above the one-dimensional Nyquist frequency, the so-called “corner” modes, in the initial conditions. We investigate this eﬀect by comparing power spectra, density distribution functions, halo mass functions, and halo proﬁles in simulations with and without these modes. For a simulation with a mass resolution of mp ∼ 1011 h−1 M , we ﬁnd that at z {\textgreater} 6, the diﬀerence in the matter power spectrum is large at wavenumbers above ∼ 80\% of {kNy}, reducing to below 2\% at all scales by z ∼ 3. Including corner modes results in a better match between low- and high-resolution simulations at wavenumbers around the Nyquist frequency of the low-resolution simulation, but the eﬀect of the corner modes is smaller than the eﬀect of particle discreteness. The diﬀerences in mass functions are 3\% for the smallest halos at z = 6 for the mp ∼ 1011 h−1 M simulation, but we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the stacked proﬁles of wellresolved halos at z ≤ 6. Thus removing power at {\textbar}k{\textbar} {\textgreater} {kNy} in the initial conditions of cosmological simulations has a small eﬀect on small scales and high redshifts, typically below a few percent.},

	abstract = {Future Large Scale Structure surveys are expected to improve over current bounds on primordial non-Gaussianity ({PNG}), with a signiﬁcant impact on our understanding of early Universe physics. The level of such improvements will however strongly depend on the extent to which late time non-linearities erase the {PNG} signal on small scales. In this work, we show how much primordial information remains in the bispectrum of the non-linear dark matter density ﬁeld by implementing a new, simulation-based, methodology for joint estimation of primordial non-Gaussian amplitudes ({fNL}) and standard Λ{CDM} parameters. The estimator is based on optimally compressed statistics, which, for a given input density ﬁeld, combine power spectrum and modal bispectrum measurements, and numerically evaluate their covariance and their response to changes in cosmological parameters. In this ﬁrst analysis, we focus on the matter density ﬁeld, and we train and validate the estimator using a large suite of N-body simulations (Quijote-png), including diﬀerent types of {PNG} (local, equilateral, orthogonal). We explicitly test the estimator’s unbiasedness, optimality and stability with respect to changes in the total number of input realizations. While the dark matter power spectrum itself contains negligible {PNG} information, as expected, including it as an ancillary statistic increases the {PNG} information content extracted from the bispectrum by a factor of order 2. As a result, we prove the capability of our approach to optimally extract {PNG} information on non-linear scales beyond the perturbative regime, up to kmax = 0.5 h Mpc−1, obtaining marginalized 1-σ bounds of ∆{fNloLcal} ∼ 16, ∆{fNeqLuil} ∼ 77 and ∆{fNorLtho} ∼ 40 on a cubic volume of 1 (Gpc/h)3 at z = 1.

We review the late-time mode expansion estimator methodology which can be applied to any non-separable primordial and {CMB} bispectrum model, and we demonstrate how the method can be used to reconstruct the {CMB} bispectrum from an observational map. We extend the previous validation of the general estimator using local map simulations. We apply the estimator to the coadded {WMAP} 7-year V and W channel maps, reconstructing the {WMAP} bispectrum using l {\textless} 500 multipoles and n = 50 orthonormal 3D eigenmodes; both the mode expansion parameters and the reconstructed 3D {WMAP} bispectrum are plotted. We constrain all popular nearly scale-invariant models, ensuring that the theoretical bispectrum is well-described by a convergent mode expansion. Constraints from the local model {fNL} = 20.31 ± 27.64 and the equilateral model {fNL} = 10.19±127.38 ({FNL} = 1.90±23.79) are consistent with previously published results. (Here, we use a nonlinearity parameter {FNL} normalised to the local case, to allow more direct comparison between diﬀerent models.) Notable new constraints from our method include those for the constant model {FNL} = 7.82 ± 24.57, the ﬂat model {FNL} = 7.31 ± 26.22, and warm inﬂation {FNL} = 2.10 ± 25.83. We investigate feature models, which break scale invariance, surveying a wide parameter range for both the scale and phase (scanning for feature models with an eﬀective period l∗ {\textgreater} 150). We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant evidence of non-Gaussianity for all cases well-described by the given eigenmodes. In the overall non-Gaussian analysis, we ﬁnd one anomalous mode n = 33 with a 3.39σ amplitude which could give rise to an oscillatory model signal with l∗ ≤ 150. We propose a measure F¯{NL} for the total integrated bispectrum and ﬁnd that the measured value is consistent with the null hypothesis that {CMB} anisotropies obey Gaussian statistics. We argue that this general bispectrum survey with the {WMAP} data represents the best test of Gaussianity to date and we discuss future prospects with higher precision and resolution, notably from the Planck satellite.},

            We extend the modal decomposition method, previously applied to compress the information in the real-space bispectrum to the anisotropic redshift-space galaxy bispectrum. In the modal method approach, the bispectrum is expanded on a basis of smooth functions of triangles and their orientations, such that a set of modal expansion coefficients can capture the information in the bispectrum. We assume a reference survey and compute Fisher forecasts for the compressed modal bispectrum and two other basis decompositions of the redshift-space bispectrum in the literature, one based on (single) spherical harmonics and another based on tripolar spherical harmonics. In each case, we compare the forecasted constraints from the compressed statistic with forecasted constraints from the full uncompressed bispectrum which includes all triangles and orientations. Our main result is that all three compression methods achieve good recovery of the full information content of the bispectrum, but the modal decomposition approach achieves this the most efficiently: only 14 (42) modal expansion coefficients are necessary to obtain constraints that are within 10 (2) per cent of the full bispectrum result. The next most efficient decomposition is the one based on tripolar spherical harmonics, while the spherical harmonic multipoles are the least efficient.},

	abstract = {We present the implementation of a fast estimator for the full dark matter bispectrum of a three-dimensional particle distribution relying on a separable modal expansion of the bispectrum. The computational cost of accurate bispectrum estimation is negligible relative to simulation evolution, so the isotropic bispectrum can be used as a standard diagnostic whenever the power spectrum is evaluated. As an application we measure the evolution of gravitational and primordial dark matter bispectra in \$N\$-body simulations with Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial conditions of the local, equilateral, orthogonal and flattened shape. The results are compared to theoretical models using a 3D visualisation, 3D shape correlations and the cumulative bispectrum signal-to-noise, all of which can be evaluated extremely quickly. Our measured bispectra are determined by \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(50)\$ coefficients, which can be used as fitting formulae in the nonlinear regime and for non-Gaussian initial conditions. In the nonlinear regime with \$k{\textless}2h{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, we find an excellent correlation between the measured dark matter bispectrum and a simple model based on a `constant' bispectrum plus a (nonlinear) tree-level gravitational bispectrum. In the same range for non-Gaussian simulations, we find an excellent correlation between the measured additional bispectrum and a constant model plus a (nonlinear) tree-level primordial bispectrum. We demonstrate that the constant contribution to the non-Gaussian bispectrum can be understood as a time-shift of the constant mode in the gravitational bispectrum, which is motivated by the one-halo model. The final amplitude of this extra non-Gaussian constant contribution is directly related to the initial amplitude of the constant mode in the primordial bispectrum. We also comment on the effects of regular grid and glass initial conditions on the bispectrum.},
