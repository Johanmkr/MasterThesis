\section{The homogeneous Universe}
In this chapter I will focus on explaining the background cosmology in light of a homogeneous universe. A natural place to start is the cosmological principle, followed by a description of the geometry of space itself. If not otherwise stated, the development of this chapter is based on ~\cite{dodelson2020modern}, ~\cite{weinberg2008cosmology} and \TODO{cite Baumann}

\subsection{The Robertson-Walker Metric}
\begin{equation}
    ds^2 = -dt^2 + a^2(t) \left[ \frac{dr^2}{1-kr^2} + r^2 d\Omega^2 \right]
\end{equation}

\subsection{The Friedmann Equations}
