[] - Why is the matter power spectra from CLASS different? It appears that the power spectrum file output (inferred from gravitational potential) does not differ much between synchronous and newtonian gauge. Is this because it is inferred from the potential?
[] - Gauge stuff, explanantion about how power spectra in the different gauges appear.
