## Summary of the summer project

### Getting to grips with the project and tasks involved
Quite some time was spent in the beginning just getting to grips with the task. Personally it was important to have some clear understand what the whole objective was; what are we aiming for, and which achievements are deemed realistic. This was obtained in due order, alongside some testing of software. 

### Theory - article reading
The academic level of most articles are beyond my current level of understanding. However, I am able to draw some information and general conclusions from them, so they are obviously not a waste to spend time on. However, some deeper theoretical understanding is necessary in order to work on this project in an efficient manner. This is postponed until the software works and time allows. With time we will also see which goals are realisic to achieve and not. 

### Learning the software
I needed to learn how to use the gevolution code by Julian Adamek. This would produce the N-body simulations used in the project. 

### Producing the simulations
This went faster than anticipated due to the high level of parallelism both in the simulation itself, and since I manage to run various seeds across multiple computing nodes at UiO. In two days I ran simulations of 2000 seeds, both with newtonian and genereal relativistic gravity theoryies. Each gravity theory provided snapshots at 6 different redshfifts so $ 6 \times 2  \times 2.000 = 24.000 $ datacubes with resolution $(256)^3$, and boxsize $5120$ Mpc. dot took a lot of initial testing of different boxsizes and resolutions before the final output was decided. From the simulations, numerous power spectra were also outputed. 

### Machine learning part
The machine learning part involved learning the basics of pytorch as a ML framework, and to build simple network to work on ideal test datasets. This was augmentet to include small convolutional neural networks to work on small size datacubes generated by gevolution. Here, there were no noticeable difference between the newtonian and relativistic simulations, as is expected since these were run on small scales with low resolution. 


### File structure and automatisation
Spent some time to create a file structure and write shell scripts to automate the working process, especially when generating the data. 


### Left off:
The final thing of the summer project was to start analysing the power spectra outputted by gevolution, and compare them with power spectra from CAMB or CLASS.
