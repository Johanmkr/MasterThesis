# Things to do
 
## Bispectrum

 [] - Get BFast to work on the GPU (maybe ask Farbod or perhaps Christophe about this)
 [] - Decide on how I want to have the Bispectrum investigation. 
 [] - Work on the bispectrum theory

## 3 level PT -> Need analytical/independant expression of the gravitational potential power spectrum

 [] - Find out how to calculate the potential power spectrum for use in 3 level PT. This works alright if I use the power spectra from each cube, but that feels like cheating.
 [] - Calculate the analytical 3 level PT bispectrum from some cubes in order to test their validity. 
 [] - Use the above analytical expression for gravitational potential power spectra to validate the power spectra found with Pylians.
 

## Bispectra (without 3levelPT)

 [] - Document how the catalogue of bispectra were calculated. 
 [] - Rebin the bisepctra in order to create a smoother function.
 [] - find averages and calculate the variance and make error bars.
 [] - find out if difference is within this error or not.
